<h1>Sunquest Handling Counter</h1>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>To track the productivity of the processors, a report has been sent every week that has data on all outpatient lab staff including the processors. This report contains their tech code, the patient, the test name, what activity was done, and what date and time it was performed. This was previously manually filtered to get only the processors and email them their totals for the month. </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>Using a VBA script, a tool was created that will take all the report for the month and create a report that will total the activities for each tech. It also has a graphic to show the production of each tech. It can then send an email to the tech that gives them the total for the month. </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>Previously it took 4 hours a month to compile the report and now it takes less than 10 minutes. </p>
