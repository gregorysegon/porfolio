  <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I’m naturally curious and enjoy learning new things, especially when it helps me do my 
    work better. I’m organized, detail-oriented, and disciplined — traits that show up in how 
    I approach problems and follow projects through to completion. I take ownership of my work 
    and take pride in improving processes and systems that help move a business forward.

    I enjoy collaborating with others and working as part of a team to meet shared goals. I 
    don’t shy away from challenges — I tend to take them head-on, because I genuinely enjoy 
    solving problems and learning along the way. I bring a broad range of skills to my work 
    and am always looking for opportunities to apply them, grow them, and pick up new ones.
